# Next-level-web-service
Experimentation on implementing a web service using Next.js on Zeit serverless platform. It has both UI and API implementation.

Working demo: https://next-level-web-service.anterotan.now.sh

## UI
The web service serves a simple UI but utilizes some advanced web technologies such as code splitting, server side rendering and CSS-in-JS.
It also uses some of the latest React features like hooks and integrates with material-ui library.

## API
API implementation queries data from NASA API, processes that data into some key figures and returns that to the client.
API is easily extendable and you can introduce a new endpoint by just adding a new js files under /api folder.
This project also contains couple of tests for current API endpoints.
